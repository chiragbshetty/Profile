DEMO_SQL_CODE.SQL

The Demo_SQL_Code.sql file contains queries that I developed for one of my Master's project. 
The queries were part of the database solution that we built for our client Cannonball Projects Inc.
The objective of the project was to architect and develop a database to manage resources for 
  Tech Launch Arizona - A platform to connect entrepreneurs and investors.
The queries include various procedures and triggers that are based on CRUD operations or user actions.



utlVspeeds.py

This is one of the many code snippets in Python that I had written during my work as a Software Developer.
The utility performs the function of looking up databases for values based on parameters passed by the tester and
  perform database lookups and interpolations to return a single speed value for the parameters passed.
This tool reduced a lot of manual effort for each engineer involved in the project and saved around $500,000 annually
  in man hours as there were several engineers who benefitted from this tool improving overall productivity by 40%.
